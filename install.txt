==EJabberd setup==

* assume you have ejabberd setup with jabber.yourserver.org and able to handle anonymous connections (see 
ejabberd_setup.txt)

* assuming also that you have set up bosh and have it working correctly (see ejabberd_setup.txt gotchas section)

* then you need to add the relevant user:

ejabberdctl register telly jabber.yourserver.org password

==Main html / js frontend (index.html) ==

The idea is that anyone who goes to the url is placed in a group of friends and can drag and drop items between them.
Because it's anonymous we need something to coordinate and ensure they all become friends: that's what the brain does.
It's possible that groups might be better, but that woudd require rearchitecting, and we've not done that yet.

Installaton is just a matter of dropping the filetree somewhere convenient on your server with the *same domain* as 
the Bosh connection.

==Ruby backend==

This is the 'brain' that collates information about connections and redistributes them (telly@).
It also forwards connections between XMPP and XBMC via the http API for XBMC.

you need to do:

sudo gem install json_pure
sudo gem install xmpp4r

assuming you have done

ejabberdctl register telly jabber.yourserver.org password

then it's just
nohup ruby brain.rb &

==XBMC==

To play videos by dragging and dropping onto the TV, you need to download and install XBMC (10.1 or better): 
http://xbmc.org/download/, start it up and then go to system->network and check 'allow control of XBMC via http'. 
brain.rb assumes the port is the default 8080.
