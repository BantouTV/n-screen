==Quick start==

Asssuming you have ejabberd working with bosh, you can justdo this (assuming Ubuntu)

To show the basic demo:

sudo apt-get install git-core

cd /var/ww/
git clone git://github.com/notube/n-screen.git

cd n-screen/

nano conf.js 
[[
var server = "eurovision.foaf.tv"; 
]]

su root

ejabberdctl register telly jabber.yourserver.org somepassword

cd ruby
sudo gem install json_pure
sudo gem install xmpp4r

nano brain.rb

[[
  def initialize
    self.jid = "telly@jabber.yourserver.org" #fixme for your server
    self.password = "password" #fixme for your server
]]


nohup ruby brain.rb &

go to 
http://jabber.yourserver.org/n-screen/ (or wherever you put it)


==Main html / js frontend (index.html) ==

The idea is that anyone who goes to the url is placed in a group of friends and can drag and drop items between them.
Because it's anonymous we need something to coordinate and ensure they all become friends: that's what the brain does.

Installaton is just a matter of dropping the filetree somewhere convenient on your server with the *same domain* as 
the Bosh connection.

==Ruby backend==

This is the 'brain' that collates information about connections and redistributes them (telly@).
It also forwards connections between XMPP and XBMC via the http API for XBMC.

you need to do:

sudo gem install json_pure
sudo gem install xmpp4r

assuming you have done

ejabberdctl register telly jabber.yourserver.org password

then it's just
nohup ruby brain.rb &

==XBMC==

To play videos by dragging and dropping onto the TV, you need to download and install XBMC (10.1 or better): 
http://xbmc.org/download/, start it up and then go to system->network and check 'allow control of XBMC via http'. 
brain.rb assumes the port is the default 8080.
