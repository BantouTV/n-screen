==N-screen==

This is a web-based application that allows multiple people to go to a URL in a browser, drag and drop programmes 
between each other, and drag and drop programmes to a 'TV' (XBMC installation) to play them. It can be used to find 
and watch on-demand TV when 'together but apart'. You can see a video here:

The setup is currently a bit complicated. It requires an EJabberd installation with Bosh enabled, and a Ruby backend 
server including various gems installed. The actual client is very simple though - javascript and HTML with strophe 
and jquery - it works in modern browsers. The eJabberd server can be on a separate machine. The ruby brain needs to be 
on the same machine as the XBMC installation.

Here we've included sample data and images for some archive.org video content so you can see how it might work. The 
numbers of videos are quite small so we've just included the data here, but you could also use APIs to get the data 
and / or store the videos locally rather than remotely. conf_bbc.js shows how remote data apis might work, and 
conf_rai.js how it might work if your videos and data were local.
