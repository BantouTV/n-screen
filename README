This is an experimental system exploring 'drag and drop' communication of items
between screens (e.g. tablet PCs, multi-touch tables, TV and media devices).

The initial implementation uses XMPP, and focusses on transfer of program items only.

Possible extensions could include passing of topics, of links into areas of a collection, 
or of items passed into the browser using drag and drop from the host operating system.
